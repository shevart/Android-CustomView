# Android-CustomView
I started to learn custom views drawing and you can see my modest attempts here

# Circle Views
In this module I will work with different circle views - speedometers, indicators and other. 
There is my road map for this section:
- SimpleCircleProgressBar - simple circle indicator
- *TrioCircleProgressBar* - like SimpleCircleProgressBar but with 3 lines one under one
- *SimpleSpeedometerView* - you can use this view for car dashboard UI or network speed testing.
